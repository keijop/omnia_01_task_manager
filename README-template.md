## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive layout
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - Embedded JS templating
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JS runtime 
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Node web framework
- [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) - Authentication middleware for Node/Express web apps
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) -  Relational database management system   
   
### Deployed with   

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Cloud platform, PaaS
- [JawsDB MySQL](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/jawsdb) - Heroku add-on for MySQL database


### What I learned

During this project I have been able to develop new and existing core skills:
- use of SQL database in Node/Express application
- conceptual understanding of Express framework and middleware
- http protocol  
- user authentication with Passport.js local strategy with sessions
- password reset flow with e-mail and token
  

### Continued development

In future projects I plan to dive deeper into REST API design conventions and patterns, get skilled on MERN stack and implement more complex user authentication strategies and features.   


### Useful resources

- [Coding Addict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNV0_7QRDwY) - Node Express fundamentals
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sFp_AvHc8) - This thorough video tutorial helped me to understand Passport.js local strategy and the underlying logic and flow based on sessions and cookies.
