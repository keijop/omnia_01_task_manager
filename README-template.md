### What I learned

During this project I have been able to develop new and existing core skills:
- use of SQL database in Node/Express application
- conceptual understanding of Express framework and middleware
- http protocol  
- user authentication with Passport.js local strategy with sessions
- password reset flow with e-mail and token
  

### Continued development

In future projects I plan to dive deeper into REST API design conventions and patterns, get skilled on MERN stack and implement more complex user authentication strategies.
